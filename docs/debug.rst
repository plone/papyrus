Debug
=====

When you are working on the docs, and you added, changed or formatted pages,
you want to make sure they look OK in HTML.

For small changes where you just want to see that the formatting went well, it
can be enough to use for example `OmniMarkupPreviewer <https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/OmniMarkupPreviewer>`_ this Sublime addon will create html from your rst code.

However for larger changes you really want to check how it will look like on `docs.plone.org <http://docs.plone.org>`_.

If you 'just' worked on text, you do not want to generate all the screenshots
with robot-framework, because this will take a long time.

You can run::

    make debug

This will create the docs, without using robot-framework to generate all screenshots, it will also use more CPU power of your machine to speed
things up.

Branch
------

If you are working on a branch of the docs for example *add-examples* then you can also switch to this branch:

    - clone payrus
    - setup payrus
    - switch to source/documentation
    - git checkout *add-examples*
    - go back into papyrus /root
    - make debug

If you're working on robot-screenshots, do not use *make debug* because this runs without robot tests.
See file robots.rst in this directory.


At the moment this is only configured for the English documentation,
if you want to have this feature for another languages, please open a ticket or
send a pull request !
