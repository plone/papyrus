[assembly-information]
# first numeric argument is the order for symlinking,
# then a dash as separator,
# second argument is either
# - the package path to documentation in mr.developers sources-dir
# - or a COMMAND (executed before the sym-linking)

#The numbering system is just about order of execution, since there is no implicit order in buildout cfg files key/value assignments.

#Execution order is important, because it builds a tree and you can't symlink at non-existent places, so some pulls have to be done before others
#x-COMMAND is executed before the other x-{PACKAGENAME}.
#Higher numeric order means executed later in the process

#This information is used to generate a script which is then executed as a command.
#The script will change the checkouts to 'sparse' checkouts, meaning just the doc directory and the top-level README.rst and CHANGES.rst will be left.
#The script will also symlink the externally fetched (now sparse) packages to the right place in the documentation

#NOTE: this relies on symlinking, and thus on a filesystem that supports that.
